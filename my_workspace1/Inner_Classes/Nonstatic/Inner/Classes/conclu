1. For creating the instance of nonstatic innerclass
-------we should definitely create the instance of outerclass, and using that outerclass instance only, 
-------we can call the constructor of nonstatic innerclass to create it's instance
 
       for ex, 
          OuterClass a=new OuterClass();
          OuterClass.InnerClass b =a.new InnerClass();
          


2. For inheriting nonstatic innerclass
-------we should definitely invoke the constructor of nonstatic innerclass inside the constructor of 
-------child or inheriting class and the only possible way of accesing and invoking constructor of nonstatic
 -------innerclass is by using the outerclass reference variable as the innerclass is nonstatic 
 
     for ex,
     public class Inheritingclass extends OuterClass.NonStaticInnerClass
       {
	      static OuterClass aa=new OuterClass();
	      public Inheriting4()
	      {
	         aa.super();
		
	      }
	      
	      public static void main(String[] args)
	      {
	      } 
	      
	    }
